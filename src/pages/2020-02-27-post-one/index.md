The creative challenge was to design a website that represents a modern look with a simple UI. The solution was to use a blue color as the primary color because it works well in the tech industry.

To make UI easy to use, I use color contrast to show buttons or call-to-action. I used the CSS grid for the store layout as it works best for navigation and responsiveness. I hope you love this design.

I hope you love the design :)
