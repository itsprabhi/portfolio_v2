The goal of the design is to encourage people to signup and join the organization. To achieve it, I designed two signup forms on the page. One form serves as the main form and the other is above the fold to capture the user's attention and ease the signing up.

The front page also has a little description of the business, which helps the user to know a little more about the business with a CTA to the about page. The color scheme is consistent throughout the page to create an element of branding.
